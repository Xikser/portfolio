                    h3.viewer__title ZSE E-sport League

                    p.viewer__text ZSE E-Sport League was a small school project that has grown to a national scale cs:go tournament, entirely prepared, run and managed by students. My first task was to create a website with team registration in PHP (never again). It was my first website, so it had been coded terribly, but it worked :D

                    p.viewer__text I was also responsible for cs:go servers, voice servers, technical aspect of streaming during the LAN finals, and I also managed a group of 5 administrators, that I had to train in server maintenance beforehand.

                    p.viewer__text Several of my friends, whom I trained to handle cs:go servers and conducting matches, worked / work in ESL as a game administrator after the end of the project.

                    h3.viewer__title Minecraft Server

                    p.viewer__text Since 2015, I have been creating servers for Minecraft. Several of them have achieved success. The number of people playing at the same time was often over 100. Currently, I have been "retired" Minecraft for about 2 years.
